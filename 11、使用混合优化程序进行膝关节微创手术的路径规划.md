## Aim & Method
> The aim of this study was to develop a method for medical tool path planning in minimally-invasive knee surgery. The procedure was to provide an optimized (minimally-invasive) and collision-free path given the final location of the tool. The knee elements and the tool were described with surface meshes. The tool displacement was also constrained by a circular incision in the skin. The collision-free paths were obtained using the control locations method and Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RC-GA) and then further optimized with Nedler-Mead method (NMM).

本研究的目的是开发一种用于微创膝关节手术的医疗工具路径规划的方法。该程序是为了给工具的最终位置提供一个优化的（微创的）和无碰撞的路径。膝关节元素和工具是用表面网格描述的。工具的位移也被皮肤上的一个圆形切口所限制。无碰撞路径是用控制位置法和真实编码遗传算法（RC-GA）获得的，然后用Nedler-Mead方法（NMM）进一步优化。
