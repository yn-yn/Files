## classical approaches

### cell decomposition (CD)

> This approach divides the region into non-overlapping grids (cells) and uses connectivity graphs for traversing from one cell to another to achieve the goal. During traversing, pure cells (cells without obstacles) are considered to achieve path planning from the initial position to the target position. Corrupted cells (cells containing obstacles) present in the path are further divided into two new cells to get a pure cell and this pure cell gets added to the sequence while determining the optimal path from the initial position to the target position. In the CD approach, the initial position and target position are represented by the start and end cells. The sequence of pure cells that joins these positions shows the required path [4‒5]. The CD approach is classified as adaptive, approximate and exact.

这种方法将区域划分为不重叠的网格（单元），并使用连接图从一个单元穿越到另一个单元以实现目标。在遍历过程中，纯单元（没有障碍物的单元）被考虑用来实现从初始位置到目标位置的路径规划。在确定从初始位置到目标位置的最佳路径时，将路径中存在的损坏单元（含有障碍物的单元）进一步分成两个新的单元，以得到一个纯单元，这个纯单元被添加到序列中。在CD方法中，初始位置和目标位置由起点和终点单元表示。连接这些位置的纯单元的序列显示了所需的路径。CD方法分为自适应的、近似的和精确的。

① exact cell decomposition

> Cells do not have a specific shape and size, but can be determined by the map of environment, shape, and location of the obstacle within it.

细胞没有特定的形状和大小，但可以通过环境的地图、形状和其中的障碍物位置来确定。

② approximate cell decomposition

> In this navigation method, if the object occupies the grid space then it is treated as an obstacle or else it is considered as blank space.

在这种导航方法中，如果物体占据了网格空间，那么它就被视为障碍物，否则就被认为是空白空间。

### roadmap approach (RA)

> The RA is also known as the highway approach. It is the way to get from one place to another and the connection among the free spaces is represented by a set of one-dimensional curves. When the roadmap is built, then it is utilized as an arrangement of homogeneous ways where the planner will seek to discover the ideal arrangement. Here, nodes play an important role in getting the desired path for the robot. The RA is used to find the shortest path from the robot's initial position to its target position.

RA也被称为高速公路方式。它是从一个地方到另一个地方的方式，自由空间之间的连接由一组一维曲线来表示。当路线图建立起来后，它就被用作同质化方式的安排，规划者将寻求发现理想的安排。在这里，节点在为机器人获得理想的路径方面起着重要作用。**RA用于寻找从机器人的初始位置到目标位置的最短路径。**

### artificial potential field (APF)

> The goal and obstacles act like charged surfaces and the total potential creates the imaginary force on the robot. This imaginary force attracts the robot towards the goal and keeps it away from an obstacle as shown in Fig. 8. Here, the robot follows the negative gradient to avoid the obstacle and reach the target point.

目标点和障碍物就像带电的表面，总电势在机器人上产生了假想力。如图8所示，这个假想力将机器人吸引向目标点，并使其远离障碍物。在这里，机器人沿着负的梯度，避开障碍物，到达目标点。

## reactive approaches

### genetic algorithm (GA)

> Specifically, it deals with the optimization of difficult problems wherein we must maximize or minimize the objective function value under given constraints. In this approach, the population (different individuals characterized by genes) must be allotted for the given problem and every member of the population is assigned with a fitness value depending upon the objective function. These individuals are selected as per their fitness value and allowed to pass their genes to a new generation by crossover. The mutation maintains the diversity in population and prevents premature convergence. Finally, the algorithm is terminated if the population has converged. Although the GA is randomized in nature to some extent, its performance is better as they can exploit historical information as well when compared to a random local search.

具体来说，它涉及困难问题的优化，其中我们必须在给定的约束条件下最大化或最小化目标函数值。在这种方法中，必须为给定的问题分配人口（以基因为特征的不同个体），并根据目标函数为人口中的每个成员分配一个健身值。通过fitness value来挑选优秀个体，并允许他们的基因通过交叉传递到新的一代。变异可以保持种群的多样性，并防止过早收敛。最后，如果种群已经收敛，该算法就会终止。虽然GA在某种程度上是随机的，但它的性能更好，因为与随机的局部搜索相比，它们也可以利用历史信息。

### fuzzy logic (FL)

> It is used in situations where there is a high degree of uncertainty, complexity, and nonlinearity. Pattern recognition, automatic control, decision making, data classification are a few of them. The hypothesis of the FL framework is encouraged by the noteworthy human ability to process perception-based information. It uses the human-supplied rules (If-Then) and converts these rules to their mathematical equivalents. This streamlines the job of the system designer and computer for getting more correct information about the way systems perform in the real world and hence it is used for path planning of a mobile robot.

它被用于存在高度不确定性、复杂性和非线性的情况。模式识别、自动控制、决策、数据分类是其中的几个例子。FL框架是根据人类处理基于感知的信息的能力建立的假设。它使用人类提供的规则（If-Then）并将这些规则转换为其数学等价物。这简化了系统设计者和计算机的工作，以获得关于系统在现实世界中的执行方式的更正确的信息，因此它被用于移动机器人的路径规划。

> Nowadays, FL has been used in combination with the sensor based navigation technique to improve the incremental learning of the new environment; reinforced based navigation to minimize the angular uncertainty and radial uncertainty present in the environment; and algorithm based navigation technique such as NN, GA, APF, ACO and many more to achieve an optimal perception of the environment which enables the robot to manage a dead-end situation.

如今，FL已经与基于传感器的导航技术结合使用，以提高对新环境的增量学习。对于基于强化的导航，增加FL，以最小化环境中存在的角度不确定性和径向不确定性。对于基于算法的导航技术，如NN、GA、APF、ACO等，增加FL，以实现对环境的最佳感知，使机器人能够处理死胡同的情况。

### neural network (NN)

> Artificial NN is an intelligent system which consists of many simple and highly interconnected processing elements. These elements transfer the information by their capability of dynamic state response to external inputs. The NN is basically shown by wellorganized layers of interconnected nodes. The nodes consist of an activation function. The input layer of the NN mechanism recognizes the patterns shown below in Fig. 12. These patterns then communicate to hidden layers for actual processing via a system of weighted connections. The hidden layers connect with the output layer to give the required answer. NN characteristics such as generalization ability, massive parallelism, distributed representation, learning ability and fault tolerance make it useful in the field of mobile robot navigation.

人工神经网络是一个智能系统，它由许多简单且高度相互连接的处理元素组成。这些元素通过其对外部输入的动态状态反应能力来传递信息。人工神经网络基本上由相互连接的节点的良好组织层显示。节点包括一个激活函数。NN神经网络机制的输入层可以识别图12中的模式。这些模式然后通过一个加权连接系统传达给隐藏层进行实际处理。隐蔽层与输出层连接，给出所需答案。NN神经网络的特点，如泛化能力、大规模并行性、分布式表示、学习能力和容错性，使其在移动机器人导航领域非常有用。

#### NN与FL混合算法

> Pothal et al. have presented the hybrid approach of the NN and FL to take the benefits of both the intelligent mechanisms for multiple mobile robot navigations in a disorderly conditions. The proposed work is analyzed in the presence of a static obstacle architecture (Fig. 13).

### firefly algorithm (FA)

> Yang introduced the FA in 2008. It is inspired by the fireflies flashing behavior, although it is also referred to as the metaheuristics algorithm. Its principle comprises random states and general identification as trial and error of fireflies which is existing in nature stochastically.

Yang在2008年推出了FA算法。尽管它也被称为元启发算法, 它的灵感来自于萤火虫的闪烁行为。它的原理包括随机状态和一般识别，就像萤火虫的试验和错误一样，在自然界中随机存在。

> The pseudo code and flowchart for navigation of a robot using the FA are presented in Fig. 14. Recently the FA has been used as an optimization tool and its application is spreading in almost all areas of engineering such as mobile robot navigation.

图14展示了使用FA算法的机器人导航的伪代码和流程图。最近，FA已被用作一种优化工具，它的应用几乎遍及所有工程领域，如移动机器人导航。

### particle swarm optimization (PSO)

> This is a nature-based metaheuristic algorithm which adopts the social behavior of creatures such as fish schools and bird flocks. It is developed by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995 and it is a rapidly growing optimization tool for solving the various problems of engineering and science. The PSO mimics the behavior of the social animal but does not require any leader within the group to reach the target. When the flock of birds goes to find food, they do not require any leaders; they go with one of the members who is at the nearest position to the food (Fig. 15). In this way, the flock of birds reaches their required solution by proper communication with the members of the population. The PSO algorithm consists of a group of particles where each particle represents a potential solution. Nowadays, PSO is widely used in the field of mobile robot navigation.

这是一种基于自然的元启发式算法，采用了鱼群和鸟群等生物的社会行为。它是由Eberhart和Kennedy在1995年开发的，它是一个快速增长的优化工具，用于解决工程和科学的各种问题。PSO模仿了社会动物的行为，但不需要群体中的任何领导者来达到目标。当鸟群去寻找食物时，它们不需要任何领导；它们与离食物最近的成员之一一起去（图15）。通过这种方式，鸟群通过与种群成员的适当交流达到它们所需要的解决方案。PSO算法由一组粒子组成，每个粒子代表一个潜在的解决方案。如今，PSO被广泛用于移动机器人导航领域。

### ant colony optimization (ACO)

> ACO is a population-based approach used to solve the combinatorial optimization problem. The ACO algorithm originated from the behavior of ants and its ability to find the shortest path from their nest to a food source (Fig. 17). The ACO algorithm is already applied to various fields of science and engineering such as job-shop scheduling, vehicle routing, quadratic assignment problem, travelling salesman problems, graph coloring and many more. Nowadays, the ACO is used to handle the mobile robot navigation problem for obstacle avoidance and effective path planning. Guan-Zheng et al. presented the application of ACO for real-time path planning of mobile robots. The adoption of the ACO increases the convergence speed, solution variation, computational efficiency and dynamic convergence behavior when compared with other algorithms such as GA.

ACO（蚁群优化）是一种基于群体的方法，用于解决组合优化问题。ACO算法起源于蚂蚁的行为及其寻找从其巢穴到食物来源的最短路径的能力（图17）。ACO算法已经被应用于科学和工程的各个领域，如工作车间调度、车辆路由、二次分配问题、旅行推销员问题、图形着色等等。现在，ACO被用来处理移动机器人的导航问题，用于避开障碍物和有效的路径规划。Guan-Zheng等人介绍了ACO在移动机器人实时路径规划中的应用。**与GA等其他算法相比，ACO的采用提高了收敛速度、解的变化、计算效率和动态收敛行为。**

### bacterial foraging optimization (BFO)

> Passino in 2002 presented the new nature-inspired optimization algorithm which is originated from the behavior of an E. coli and M. Xanthus bacteria. These bacteria search for nutrients by making the best use of energy achieved per unit time. The BFO algorithm is featured by chemotaxis that perceives chemical gradients by which bacteria communicate specific signals with each other. It has four basic principles such as chemotaxis, swarming, reproduction and elimination, and dispersal. The behavior of the bacteria for searching the nutrient region is presented as below and explained in Fig. 19.

该算法源于大肠杆菌和M. Xanthus细菌的行为。这些细菌通过在单位时间内最有效地利用能量来寻找营养物质。BFO算法的特点是趋化性，即感知化学梯度，细菌通过这个梯度相互交流特定信号。它有四个基本原则，如趋化性、蜂群、繁殖和淘汰以及分散。细菌搜索营养区的行为如下，并在图19中解释。

> * Bacteria always travel in search of more nutrient regions on the map. Bacteria with sufficient food have a longer life and split into two equal parts whereas bacteria in the lesser nutrient region will disperse and die.
> * Bacteria present in the more nutrient region are attracted to others by chemical phenomenon and those who are in the lesser nutrient region give a warning signal to other bacteria using a specific signal.
Bacteria get a highly nutrient region on the map.
Bacteria are dispersed again in the map for a new region of nutrients.
