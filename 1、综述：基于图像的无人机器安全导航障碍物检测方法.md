## 障碍物检测技术大致分类
> In general, obstacle detection techniques can be divided into three groups: Image-based, sensor-based, and hybrid. In sensor-based methods, various active sensors such as lasers, radar, sonar, ultrasonic, and Kinect have been used.

一般来说，障碍物检测技术可以分为三组。基于图像的、基于传感器的、和混合的。在基于传感器的方法中，已经使用了各种主动传感器，如激光、雷达、声纳、超声波和Kinect。

## active sensors

> Sensor-based methods have their own merits and disadvantages. For instance, in addition to being reasonably priced, sonar and ultrasonic sensors can determine the direction and position of an obstacle. However, sonar and ultrasonic waves are affected by both constructive and destructive interference of ultrasonic reflections from multiple environmental obstacles. In some situations, radar waves may be an excellent alternate, mainly when no visual data is available. Nevertheless, radar sensors are not small or light, which means installing them on small robots is not always feasible. Moreover, infrared waves have a limited Field Of View (FOV), and their performance is dependent on weather conditions. Despite being a popular sensor, LiDAR is relatively large and, thus, cannot permanently be installed on small robots like MAVs. Therefore, despite their popularity and ease of use, active sensors may not be ideal for obstacle detection when weight, size, energy consumption, sensitivity to weather conditions, and radio-frequency interference issues matter.

基于传感器的方法有其自身的优点和缺点。例如，除了价格合理外，声纳和超声波传感器可以确定障碍物的方向和位置。然而，声纳和超声波会受到来自多个环境障碍物的超声波反射的建设性和破坏性干扰的影响。在某些情况下，**雷达波**可能是一个很好的替代方案，主要是在没有视觉数据的时候。尽管如此，雷达传感器的**体积和重量都不小**，这意味着将其安装在小型机器人上并不总是可行的。此外，红外波的视场角（FOV）有限，而且其性能取决于天气条件。尽管LiDAR是一种流行的传感器，但其体积相对较大，因此不能永久地安装在MAV等小型机器人上。因此，尽管主动式传感器很受欢迎且易于使用，但当重量、尺寸、能源消耗、对天气条件的敏感性和射频干扰问题很重要时，主动式传感器可能不是障碍物探测的理想选择。

## passive sensors

>Alternative to active sensors is lightweight cameras that provide visual information about the environment the robot travels in. Cameras are passive sensors and are used by numerous image-based algorithms to detect obstacles using grayscale values and point or edge features. They can provide details regarding the amount of the robot’s movement or displacement and the obstacle’s color, shape, and size. In addition to enabling real-time and safe obstacle detection, image-based techniques are not disturbed by environmental electromagnetic noises. Additionally, the visual data can be used to guide the robot through various image-based navigation techniques currently available.

主动式传感器的替代品是轻量级的照相机，它能提供关于机器人所处环境的视觉信息。摄像机是被动式传感器，被许多基于图像的算法用于使用灰度值和点或边缘特征来检测障碍物。它们可以**提供有关机器人的运动量或位移以及障碍物的颜色、形状和大小的细节**。除了实现实时和安全的障碍物检测外，基于图像的技术不受环境电磁噪声的干扰。此外，视觉数据可用于通过目前可用的各种基于图像的导航技术来引导机器人。

## Hybrid sensors

>Hybrid techniques integrate data from active and passive sensors, which would benefit and also suffer from the weaknesses of both systems. Several studies have been carried out in this field (see Table 2). However, it should be noted that fusing the data from multiple sources has difficulties and complexities, such as accurate calibration of multi-sensor systems. Additionally, only a few studies have been conducted on the real-time use of multiple heterogeneous sensors, typically asynchronous. The data collected by various sensors is not homogeneous and usually requires complicated data processing.

混合技术整合了来自主动和被动传感器的数据，这将受益于这两个系统，同时也受到这两个系统的缺点的影响。然而，应该注意的是，融合多个来源的**数据有困难和复杂性**，如多传感器系统的精确校准。此外，只有少数研究是关于多个异质传感器的实时使用，通常是异步的。各种传感器收集的数据不是同质的，通常需要复杂的数据处理。
